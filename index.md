Hello, world! My name is Megan Stumpf and I am a 4th year Ph.D. Candidate in the Immunology Program at the University of Colorado - Anschutz Medical Campus. I am a member of the Morrison Lab where we study **alphaviruses** and *immune responses* to them. You can check out more information about our work, here: [lab website](https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/immunology-and-microbiology/immu-micro-labs/morrison-lab).

**ATTENTION:** *Currently exploring job opportunities!* If you, or someone you know have a post-doctoral or staff position available, please reach out to me via email or on LinkedIn (both linked below). Thanks!
